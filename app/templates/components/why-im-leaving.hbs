<p>Hi friends and family, it's true, I'm leaving Apple.</p>
<p>On hearing this news, people tend to want an explanation, and so here I hope to answer your questions. I made some sections clickable for more detail, because this is the type of skill I have now, and I'm using it to express myself here.</p>

{{#collapse-question header="Was it Apple's fault? (no)"}}
  <p>Apple's been awesome. I've learned a ton, made some great fiends, saved most of what I earned, eaten the best food of my life, and got to help out in making what still believe are some of the highest-quality computers in the world, and now I know first hand the kind of care that goes into them.</p>
  <p>There were always tradeoffs for me. The long commute (which I voluntarily endured to save money) was a big drag, and it's a side effect of the bay area being in a bit of a insane mess of economic boom right now. Even as a programmer that could supposedly be gentrifying; moving to the south bay was both more expensive than I wanted to pay, and not an area I had much interest in other than work convenience.</p>
  <p>Finally, the one thing they could never offer me is freedom to work on what I wanted to. Ultimately I'm a very self-driven person as long as I have the freedom to set my own priorities and pursue them as I like, and I have a long list of things I'd like to do, but that's something I'll probably never get in a big corporation, hence needing to spend at least some time out of one.</p>

<p>I have another project I'm excited to start on.</p>

{{#collapse-question header="What's the new project?"}}

  <p>I'll be joining my good friend Aaron Davis, building a tool called MetaMask.</p>

  {{#collapse-question header="Who's Aaron Davis?"}}
    <p><a href="http://aaron.kumavis.me/">Aaron</a> is a really brilliant friend of mine who I first met when contributing to the open source project <a href="http://voxeljs.com/">Voxel.js</a>, which united our common interests in using computers to make cool stuff more accessible to a broader audience (in that case, kids).</p>

  <p>The two big features are that you will have the chance to own and manage your online identity like never before, and you will get to participate in a decentralized web of the future.</p>
  <p>First, a bit on identity. At the moment you always ask someone else to verify your identity. You go to the DMV to get a license, you sign in with Facebook on other sites, you hope nobody learns your social security number which you write on the application for every job you apply to.</p>
  <p>Metamask is going to be a convenient way for you to manage your own secured identities, allowing you to be logged in with your browser (or eventually phone) across all sites on this new web.</p>
  <p>This new web will have new sites that will not necessarily be owned by companies, or anyone. They will not run secret code on private servers. They will be incapable of censorship, and will only cost about what the servers cost to run, even without ads (probably pennies for most things).</p>
  <p>It'll take a while for the decentralized web to work as smooth as the one we have now, but the long vision includes things like:</p>
  <p> - Uber without uber. Just passengers paying drivers.</p>
  <p> - Airbnb without Airbnb. Just people renting space from each other.</p>
  <p> - New currencies with new properties. What if inflation didn't go to central banks, but was distributed evenly? (Some see a potential for a basic income without requiring government participation)</p>
  <p> - Transparent organizations whose entire budget is provably accurate, along with their entire constitution and voting processes.</p>
  <p> - Businesses that have no owners, and only function to serve people. http://singularityhub.com/2016/02/16/how-ownerless-firms-will-soon-live-on-the-blockchain/?utm_content=buffer372cf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer</p>
  <p>- Kickstarter but without censorship, trading real equity, and whatever else you can imagine. https://medium.com/@Digix/where-does-vc-money-come-from-what-is-digix-fighting-for-a7b0b5f31d14</p>
  <p>This new web is just being built now, and if you're interested in learning more, the platform is called Ethereum. It's built on the principles of Bitcoin, but instead of simply being a distributed ledger, it's a fully distributed computer.</p>
  <p>Best of all, I've found in Ethereum a community of people who are incredibly inspired and optimistic and intelligent, and who make normal out of dreaming the fantastic.</p>
  <p>My work on Metamask will be subsidized by the Consensys collective; a flat, non-hierarchical organization that will be continuously upgrading its own constitution and processes transparently on the very decentralized web it is building, just like it hopes to empower anyone to do in the future, which satisfies my need for self-referential direct action.</p>
  <p>As a bonus, this will also mean my career is no longer tied to a specific time and place, but by a purpose, which has been one of my complaints about jobs since I first started having to think about them.</p>
{{/collapse-question}}

<p>Hopefully bettering society. Greater personal freedom. More exciting topics of work. Being allowed to talk about what I do again!</p>
<p>So yeah, that's why I'm leaving Apple. Maybe I'll go back someday once I'm done with these other interests. It has been a great time, and I'm leaving an awesome team of friends behind.</p>
<p>Hopefully this has answered your big questions, and you feel like you have the faintest idea of why I would throw a job like that away.</p>
